# <name>
# Defines the experiment name which is: 
#   1. Used as the experiment name of Azure ML jobs.
#   2. Used as the name of the model when it is registered in Azure ML.

name: <experiment_name>

# <flow>
# Defines the standard flow of the experiment. 
# If the variable is not set, the experiment name is used. 
# If it is set, it should be the path to the folder containing the Prompt Flow files
# (including flow.dag.yaml).
#
# Note: It is recommended to keep all flow folders (standard and evaluators) in a 
# common "flows" folder. If that structure is used, the name of the flow folder can 
# can be used as the flow_name instead of the path to it. The library will 
# automatically check the flows directory (i.e., "flows/<flow_name>") first to 
# look for the standard flow.

flow: <flow_name>

# <datasets>
# Defines the datasets used for the standard flow in this experiment.
# Each dataset listed will be used to run the standard flow; it can also be used
# to run one or more of the evaluation flows (see below). 
# If the dataset is referencing a local dataset, it will be uploaded to Azure ML.
#
# Properties of a dataset. 
# - name: the unique name used to reference the dataset.
#   source: reference to an existing dataset in Azure ML <azureml:$name:$version> or path to local dataset.
#   description: description used for the dataset when uploaded to Azure ML. Optional, only 
#         used when source is set to a path of a local file.
#   mappings: the mapping from the input of the standard Prompt Flow flow, to the column
#          name of the dataset where the input will be read from. Must use syntax 
#          `${data.<column_name>}`.

# <evaluators>
# Defines the evaluators used in the experiment. Each evaluator is a Prompt Flow flow. 
# Each evaluator requires a dataset. The dataset must already be defined above (meaning 
# it was used to run the standard flow) OR it must contain a reference to a dataset from
# above. The result of the standard flow with the matching dataset is used as input to 
# the evaluation flow.
# 
# Properties of an evaluator
# - name: the unique name used to reference the evaluator.
#   flow: the path to the flow folder. As noted above, the library will automatically
#         check the flows directory (i.e., "flows/<flow_name>") first to look for the
#         evaluator flow.
#   datasets:
#   - name: name of the dataset used. Must match the unique name of one of the datasets 
#         listed above, OR must have "source" and "reference" parameter and the "reference"
#         parameter must match the unique name of one of the datasets listed above.
#     source: reference to an existing dataset in Azure ML <azureml:$name:$version> or path 
#         to local dataset. Optional, only required when the "name" parameter doesn't match
#         any of the datasets listed above.
#     description: description used for the dataset when uploaded to Azure ML. Optional, only 
#         used when "source" is set to a path of a local file.
#     reference: name of the reference dataset. Must match the unique name of one of the 
#         datasets listed above.  Optional, only required when the "name" parameter doesn't 
#         match any of the datasets listed above.
#     mappings: the mapping from the input of the evaluation Prompt Flow flow, to the column
#         name of the dataset where the input will be read from OR to the output of the 
#         standard run using the same dataset. Must use syntax `${data.<column_name>}` or 
#         "${run.outputs.<output_name>}".
