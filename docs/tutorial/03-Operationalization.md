# Tutorial 03-Operationalization

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of operationalizing of a LLM flow using Prompt Flow.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the previous tutorials ([Tutorial 01](01-Introduction.md) and [Tutorial 02](02-Development.md)) and have a working LLM flow.

## Exercises

Follow the steps as mentioned in the [How to setup the repo with Github Workflows](../github_workflows_how_to_setup.md) document to setup the repo with Github Workflows.

## Expected Outcome

- A Pull Request (PR) validation Github Workflow that validates the flow while a PR is created.
- A CI Github Workflow that validates, evaluate and deploys the flow when a PR is merged to the main branch.
- An optional Post Deployment Github Workflow that evaluates the deployed flow.
