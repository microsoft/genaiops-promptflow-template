# Tutorial 01: Introduction to LLMOps

    The new AI imperative: Unlock repeatable value for your organization with LLMOps - By John Montgomery, Corporate Vice President, Microsoft Azure

_Time and again, we have seen how AI helps companies accelerate what’s possible by streamlining operations, personalizing customer interactions, and bringing new products and experiences to market. The shifts in the last year around generative AI and foundation models are accelerating the adoption of AI within organizations as companies see what technologies like Azure OpenAI Service can do. They’ve also pointed out the need for new tools and processes, as well as a fundamental shift in how technical and non-technical teams should collaborate to manage their AI practices at scale._

_This shift is often referred to as LLMOps (large language model operations). Even before the term LLMOps came into use, Azure AI had many tools to support healthy LLMOps already, building on its foundations as an MLOps (machine learning operations) platform._
