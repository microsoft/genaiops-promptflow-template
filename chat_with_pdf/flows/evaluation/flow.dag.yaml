      <strong>Rating:</strong> 3\\n <strong>Review:</strong> I bought the
      TrailMaster X4 Tent, and while it's waterproof and has a spacious
      interior, I found it a bit difficult to set up. It's a decent tent, but I
      wish it were easier to assemble.</p>\\n<p>3) <strong>Rating:</strong> 5\\n
      <strong>Review:</strong> The TrailMaster X4 Tent is a fantastic investment
      for any serious camper. The easy setup and spacious interior make it
      perfect for extended trips, and the waterproof design kept us dry in heavy
      rain.</p>\\n<p>4) <strong>Rating:</strong> 4\\n <strong>Review:</strong> I
      like the TrailMaster X4 Tent, but I wish it came in more colors. It's
      comfortable and has many useful features, but the green color just isn't
      my favorite. Overall, it's a good tent.</p>\\n<p>5)
